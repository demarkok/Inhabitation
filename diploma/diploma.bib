  abstract = {This paper is an informal introduction to the theory of types which use a connective “∧” for the intersection of two types and a constant “\$ømega\$” for a universal type, besides the usual connective “→” for function-types. This theory was first devised in about 1977 by Coppo, Dezani and Sallé in the context ofλ-calculus and its main development has been by Coppo and Dezani and their collaborators in Turin. With suitable axioms and rules to assign types toλ-calculus terms, they obtained a system in which (i) the set of types given to a term does not change underλ-conversion, (ii) some interesting sets of terms, for example the solvable terms and the terms with normal form, can be characterised exactly by the types of their members, and (iii) the type-apparatus is not so complex as polymorphic systems with quantifier-containing types and therefore probably not so expensive to implement mechanically as these systems.},

For the four essential variants of the system (with and without a universal type and with and without subtyping) we show that the emptiness (inhabitation) problem is recursively unsolvable. That is, there is no effective algorithm to decide if there is a closed term of a given type. It follows that provability in the logic of "strong conjunction" of Mints and Lopez-Escobar is also undecidable.},
